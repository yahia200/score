            <p>SCORE has been supporting students since 2006, with a website that was formerly known as Maths Made Easy. Initialling a website that linked out to different resources, we have developed into a platform that creates content and advances technology within education for the benefit of all.</p>
            <p><span>Our Mission</span></p>
            <p>Weâ€™re here to support learners, improve their grades and make the best resources accessible to all.
            Committed to promoting equality through education, we have made many of our online resources free for everyone to access. </p>
